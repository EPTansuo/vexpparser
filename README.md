![Licence: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)

This repository contains a flex / bison parser for Verilog expressions.
We will use this as a refinement parser in our refinement map parser.

The flex / bison script is adapted from an open-source Verilog parser from [Here](https://github.com/zhanghongce/verilog-parser) originated from [this archived repo](https://github.com/ben-marshall/verilog-parser).
